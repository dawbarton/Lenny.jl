# Continuation problem
§2.2.1: Zero problem is `Φ:ℝⁿ→ℝᵐ`; dimensionsionality deficit is `n-m`.

§2.2.2: Continuously differentiable monitor functions `Ψ:ℝⁿ→ℝʳ`. Extended continuation problem is `F:(u,μ) ↦ (Φ(u); Ψ(u)-μ)` and has same dimensionality deficit since `F:ℝⁿ×ℝʳ→ℝᵐ×ℝʳ`.

§2.2.3: Restricted continuation problem. `𝕀⊂{1,...,r}` is an index set of cardinality `|𝕀|≤n-m` with complement `𝕁:={1,...,r}\𝕀`. The restricted continuation problem is `G:(u,μ_𝕁)↦F(u,μ)|μ_𝕀=μ_𝕀*`. This is equivalent to the reduced continuation problem `(Φ(u); Ψ_𝕀(u)-μ_𝕀*) = 0`.
